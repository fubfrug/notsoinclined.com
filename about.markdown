# About
This is an effort to start talking about automation and bringing it in to the forefront of everyone's thoughts.  With it, I envision a world Developers, Security Teams, and Operations Teams not only get along, but enable and lift each other up.  

Some of this involves creating tutorials for writing code, and at other times will include my vision of how we should all act socially to generate an environment where we are each contributing on our own level of expertise.  We are not taking over other initiatives, but enabling all other teams to better align with goals that we each set.  A lot of this involves understanding where everyone is coming from, so we each must grow to achieve this end.
